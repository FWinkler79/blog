If like me, you have a tendency to get things done, but frequently forget how you did it, then you'll understand why it is time for me now to start a blog.
Yes, you are right - this is the first blog intended entirely for myself. ðŸ˜„

So if you find anything here that you find useful, always keep in mind that I found it useful first... 

But all joking aside, I hope that some of the stuff I write down here, will be of use to someone else, too.
If it is to you, spread the word and even better: start your own blog and share what you have learnt.

`nough said. Let's get started. 

Below you can find a first collection of posts. Stay tuned for more.
