I am software architect and developer from Germany, who likes to code, try out new technologies with a pragmatic spirit and sharing his findings with others.

I am a strong believer in Open Source and sharing knowledge in a transparent way. Indeed, I think this is one way of giving something back to the world and leaving it a better place then we found it.

Hope you'll find something useful here.
